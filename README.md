Production-grade, enterprise-ready Terraform modules for deploying AWS infrastructure components. Built with security, scalability, and operational excellence as core principles.

## Overview

This repository provides a collection of reusable Terraform modules for common AWS services. Each module is independently deployable, fully tested, and follows AWS best practices. Modules can be composed together to build complete infrastructure solutions.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Required Tools:**

- **Terraform** `>= 1.3.0` - [Download](https://www.terraform.io/downloads)
- **AWS CLI** `>= 2.0` - [Installation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
- **Git** - For cloning and version control

**AWS Requirements:**

- **AWS Account** with appropriate service limits
- **IAM User/Role** with programmatic access
- **AWS Provider** `>= 5.0` (auto-installed by Terraform)

### Installation

**1. Install Terraform:**

```bash
# macOS (Homebrew)
brew tap hashicorp/tap
brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform

# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
sudo apt update && sudo apt install terraform

# Verify installation
terraform version
```

**2. Configure AWS Credentials:**

```bash
# Option 1: AWS CLI configuration (recommended)
aws configure
# Enter: Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, Region, Output format

# Option 2: Environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"

# Option 3: AWS SSO (for organizations)
aws sso login --profile your-profile

# Verify credentials
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

**3. Clone Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ivasik-k7/terraform-shared-modules.git
cd terraform-shared-modules
```

### Basic Usage

**Deploy your first module:**

```hcl
# main.tf
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = ">= 5.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "sqs_queue" {
  source = "./modules/sqs"

  queue_name              = "my-app-queue"
  visibility_timeout      = 30
  message_retention       = 345600  # 4 days
  receive_wait_time       = 20      # Long polling
  enable_dlq              = true
  max_receive_count       = 3

  tags = {
    Environment = "dev"
    Project     = "my-app"
  }
}
```

**Initialize and deploy:**

```bash
# Initialize Terraform (download providers)
terraform init

# Preview changes
terraform plan

# Apply changes
terraform apply

# Destroy resources (when done)
terraform destroy
```

### 🗺️ Planned Modules

- **S3** - Object storage with lifecycle policies and replication
- **CloudFront** - Global CDN with WAF integration
- **Lambda** - Serverless compute with event triggers
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database with global tables
- **Secrets Manager** - Credential and secret management
- **WAF** - Web Application Firewall for CloudFront and ALB

## Architecture Patterns

### Composition Model

Modules are designed to be independently useful while supporting composition:

```hcl
# Deploy complete application stack
module "aurora" {
  source = "./aurora"
  # configuration...
}

module "eks" {
  source = "./eks"
  # configuration...
}

module "ecr" {
  source = "./ecr"
  # configuration...
}
```

### Best Practices Implemented

Each module enforces:

✅ **Encryption** - All data at rest encrypted with AWS KMS  
✅ **Least Privilege** - IAM roles and security groups follow principle of least privilege  
✅ **High Availability** - Multi-AZ deployment where applicable  
✅ **Observability** - CloudWatch monitoring, logging, and alarms included  
✅ **Backup & Recovery** - Automated backups with retention policies  
✅ **Versioning** - Explicit provider and resource versioning  
✅ **Tagging Strategy** - Consistent tagging across all resources

## Security Considerations

### Credential Management

- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- Use Terraform variables marked as `sensitive = true`
- Store sensitive values in AWS Secrets Manager or environment variables
- Use AWS SSO or federated authentication

### Network Security

- Deploy resources in private subnets by default
- Use security groups for inbound/outbound rules
- Enable VPC Flow Logs for network monitoring
- Implement network ACLs for additional isolation

### Access Control

- Use IAM roles with minimum required permissions
- Enable MFA for AWS console access
- Audit IAM policies regularly
- Use resource-based policies where applicable

### Data Protection

- Enable encryption at rest (KMS) for all services
- Use encryption in transit (TLS/SSL)
- Enable versioning for stateful resources
- Implement automated backup strategies

## Module Documentation

Each module includes:

- Detailed `README.md` with examples
- Input variables with descriptions and validations
- Output values for resource information
- Required AWS permissions
- Troubleshooting guidance

See individual module directories for complete documentation.

## Contributing

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/module-improvement`
2. Make changes following Terraform conventions
3. Run `terraform fmt -recursive` to format code
4. Test module configuration locally
5. Submit pull request with description

### Code Standards

- Use `terraform fmt` for consistent formatting
- Include descriptive variable and output names
- Add validation rules for critical inputs
- Document non-obvious configurations
- Include helpful error messages in validations

### Testing

Before submitting changes:

- Run `terraform validate` on all modules
- Check for syntax errors with `terraform fmt -check`
- Review security implications
- Test with sample `tfvars` configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Provider version not available"**

- Run `terraform init -upgrade` to fetch latest compatible version
- Check [AWS Provider Changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/releases)

**"AWS credentials not found"**

- Verify AWS credentials: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
- Check environment variables: `$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
- Confirm IAM permissions for required services

**"Resource already exists"**

- Check current infrastructure: `terraform state list`
- Use `terraform import` to manage existing resources
- Review AWS Console for unmanaged resources

For module-specific issues, see the module's README file.
